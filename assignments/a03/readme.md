1. Run fEuler-msd.py file you should have position vs time plot at step size 1e-4, the largest position and velocity error at step size 1e-4, and log-log plot of "error vs step size" using forward Euler method
```
python3 fEuler-msd.py
```
2. Run DOP853.py file you should get "position vs time" and "velocit vs time" plot using Scipy ODE solver
```
python3 DOP853.py
```
3. Run bEuler-msd.py file you should have position vs time plot at step size 1e-4, the largest position and velocity error at step size 1e-4, and log-log plot of "error vs step size" using backward Euler method
```
python3 bEuler-msd.py
```
